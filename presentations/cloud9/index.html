            <p> To build apps and other things with Ruby on Rails, you need to set up <strong>2 accounts</strong>,

            </p>

            <p>We need somewhere for you to <i>write code</i> and <i>run a server</i> , and we need somewhere for you to
                <i>store and share your code</i> so you can work with other people.

            <h3>Lets create something</h3>

            <p>One of the reasons why Rails is awesome is that it comes with built-in commands that makes it easy for
                you to get started.</p>

            <p>The <code>scaffold</code> command makes it super easy to create a concept by generating all the necessary
                files and folders which you don't have to worry about.
                It also generates database tables to store information and boilerplate code of how every module
                interacts.
            </p>

            <p><code>Scaffold</code> allows you to create a concept (eg: a user, post, comments) in a single command.

                    It creates a lot of building blocks for you so you don't have to do it manually.

                    That is a whole lot of files we didn't need to create. We will discuss a few that we will be working

                    <code>app/models/idea.rb</code> is the file that keeps track of the <strong>model</strong>

                    We'll be working with this file when we add in photos.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>app/controllers/ideas_controller.rb</code> helps <strong>control</strong> and process all the
                    requests the server gets
                    for the pages <strong>ideas</strong>. There are code generated in the file for you which handles the
                    actions
                    show, create, edit, delete.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>app/views/ideas/</code> is a directory that holds all the view(HTML files) of the <strong>ideas</strong>
                    concept.
                    This is where you can pretty up the app which we will dive into in the next step.

            In a Ruby on Rails app, the user interface which is the page that the users sees, is often written in HTML
            and ERB. This code is stored in the 'views' folder under the app folder.

            HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the language that browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari) use to
            display content. HTML contains many 'tags' that is used to create your own vision of the web page.
            These tags come in pairs (an open and a close tag).
            For example, the main heading on your page will have <code>tags</code> around it.
            HTML tags use angular brackets < >.
            Your web browser uses the tags to understand how to display content.
        </section>
        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>These are tags that we will be using for the app: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>link</code> - connects assets to your page</li>
                <li><code>div</code> - a container for other content</li>
                <li><code>a</code> - link to another page</li>
                <li><code>ul</code> - unorder list, needs a list of elements</li>
                <li><code>li</code> - list element, must be part of a list</li>

            ERB (Embedded Ruby) is system in Rails that allows Ruby code to be inserted into files written in
            HTML or Javascript. The Ruby code goes within specific angle brackets <code><% </code> and <code> %></code>.
            The server executes this as Ruby code and then embed it in existing HTML.

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
          <p>
            In this tutorial, you will come across <code><%= RUBY CODE HERE %></code>, whereby the <code>=</code> comes
            after the <code><%</code> which means the contents written in ruby code will be executed and rendered on the
            page.
            For instance, if you want to show the number of ideas in your app, the code to render the number will be:
            <code>There are <%= Idea.count %> ideas </code>

            The next piece of this puzzle that makes the website pretty is CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). As before, HTML
            keeps track
            of the <i>contents</i> of the website. CSS keeps track of how the page <i>looks</i>.

            <p>
                At the moment, the app doesn't look nice. Lets go on and add some CSS to pretty it up.
                On the left panel of the editor in c9.io, open the file
                <code>app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</code>. This is your default layout file.
            </p>

            <p>
                Look for this line <code><%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" =>
                true %></code>
                Add these lines of code above this line.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap-theme.css"/>
            </code></pre>
            <p>Make sure you save the file by using the menu bar File -> Save.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
          <p>
            The <code>rel="stylesheet"</code> tells us the type of link,in this case a link relation. This basically
            tells the browser there is an
            external hyperlink to refer to. The <code>href</code> contains the address to the css file which is
            <code>//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap.css</code> and
            <code>//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap-theme.css</code>.
            Here, we are using the style sheet called Bootstrap which is made by the people from Twitter.

        <section data-background="#dddddd">

                Replace the <code> <%= yield %> </code> with

            <p>The <code> &lt;div&gt; </code> tag provides a way to divide your code into parts.</p>

            <p>In this case, we have assigned a <i>class</i> named "container" that will give us access to apply the
                same styling to that part of code.</p>

            <p>Finally, we're going to make some changes to the way our ideas display. We want to space them out a bit. Open <code>app/assets/stylesheets/application.css</code> <br>and at the bottom, add:

            <pre><code>

            <p><code>body</code> - this part is known as the selector and refers to the HTML element you wish to style.</p>
            <p><code>{ padding-top: 100px; }</code> - this part is known as the declaration; each declaration has a property which is the style attribute you wish to change <code>(padding-top)</code>, <br>and an associated value <code>(100px)</code>.</p>
            <p>Declarations always end with a semicolon and declaration groups <br>are always enclosed by curly brackets.</p>

            <h1>Adding Images</h1>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>At the moment, our app can't upload images and we need to install a piece of software to enable that.</p>
            <p>In Rails, there are a lot of plug ins that we can incorporate with our app which are called <strong>gems</strong></p>
            <p>Gems are basically libraries that contains pre-written code so that you don't have to write it from scratch.</p>
            <p>Gems are very useful to reduce duplication and errors in your code and are portable to be used in multiple projects.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>In your project menu,you'll see a file called <code>Gemfile</code>. <br>This has all the gems that came with the application we created when we used the <pre><code>rails new</code></pre> generator at the beginning.</p>
            <p>Open gemfile so you can edit it in the text editor. Under the line, <pre><code>gem 'sqlite3'</code></pre> add:</p>
            <pre><code>gem 'carrierwave'</code></pre>
            <p>The <code>sqlite3 gem</code> interfaces with our database, and <code>carrierwave</code> <br>makes it easier to upload images.</p>
            <p>Hit <code>CTRL-C</code> in the terminal to stop the server</p>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>In the terminal, run this command: </p>
            <pre><code>bundle</code></pre>
            <p>Bundler downloads all the gems that are specified in the <code>Gemfile</code> and tracks the versions to ensure that your project has a consistent environment.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>Now, we can generate the code that handles image uploads by doing: </p>
            <pre><code>rails generate uploader Picture</code></pre>
            <p>Please start your server up again.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>Open <code>app/models/idea.rb</code>. Under the line <code>class Idea < ActiveRecord::Base</code>, add:
            <pre><code>mount_uploader :picture, PictureUploader</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>Now, we need to customise the form we use for editing and uploading ideas.</p>
            <p>We're using the same bit of code to edit and upload. This is found in <code>app/models/idea.rb</code>.</p>
            <p>This code snippet is used in both <code>edit.html.erb</code> and <code>new.html.erb</code>, as the two forms are basically identical. This saves us some work! If you look at either of those pages, <br>rather than form code, it just says <code><%= render 'form' %></code>.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <section data-background="#dddddd">
              <p>If you open <code>app/views/ideas/_form.html.erb</code>, you will see the code <code>form_for(@idea)</code>.</p>

              <p>Find <code><%= f.text_field :picture %></code> and change it to:</p>
              <pre><code><%= f.file_field :picture %></code></pre>
              <p>This changes the code from asking for a text input to asking for a file input, which makes it easier for our users to upload an image.</p>

          <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>Let's take a closer look at <code>app/views/ideas/show.html.erb</code>.</p>
            <p>
            In the code <code><%= @idea.picture %></code>, @idea is what we call an 'instance variable'. Instance variables are prefixed with an @ symbol. Each <i>view</i> file (files in the app/views folder), has a corresponding controller action, where the instance variables are set.</p>
            <p>In our code, @idea is set in the ‘show’ action of the Ideas controller. It's set with the code <code>@idea = Idea.find(params[:id])</code>.</p>
            <p>This allows us to use it in the view <code>show.html.erb</code>. It uses the Rails '<strong>find</strong> method to get the ideas for our app from our database.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>The code that follows the <code>@idea</code> variable (<code>.picture</code>) tells Rails to access the ‘picture’ attribute of our resource (idea). </p>
            <p>Our new code, <code><%= image_tag(@idea.picture_url,:width => 600)</code>, uses the Ruby on Rails image_tag helper. This helper generates the HTML code <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, but retrieves the image we want to display from the folder 'public/images' where our uploaded images are stored.</p>
            <p>Rails provide helpers that generates HTML code so that you only need to write vital code and not repeat yourself writing boilerplate code.</p>
          </section>
          <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>In the <code>image_tag</code>, we have also specified the width of the image width to 600</p>
            <p>Finally, the <code>.present?</code> after <code>@idea.picture</code> is a Rails method to check if the picture exists before proceeding in executing the rest of the code.</p>

            <h1>Fine-tuning Routes</h1>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>Our Rails app would need to listen for requests from the browser and provide the correct information through a system called <strong>routing</strong>.</p>
            <p>Requests from the browser are interpreted as specific HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods.</p>
            <p> This protocol basically defines how information (usually webpages or webpage components composed of text with hyperlinks - ‘hypertext’), is formatted and transmitted across the internet. </p>
        </section>
        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <section data-background="#dddddd">
                <p>There are 4 HTTP methods: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>GET</li>
                        <li>PUT</li>
                        <li>POST</li>
                        <li>DELETE</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Rails routing system ensures the app knows what to do when it receives each of those methods for any of the resources in your app.</p>
                <p>In this application <strong>Idea</strong> is modelled as a resource. A resource is something that can be created, read, updated and deleted</p>
                <p>For example, <code>GET /ideas/new</code> will give you the form for adding a new idea.</p>
                <p><code>POST /ideas</code> will create a new idea.</p>
                <p>Need more explanation on how routing works?:</p>

            </section>

            <section data-background="#dddddd">
                <p> Rails’ inbuilt routing system automatically generates routes for each resource that map to specific actions (index, show, new, edit, create, update, delete) defined in the controller.
                     So, for each of our models, there are seven related actions defined in the associated controller,
                     <code>ideas_controller.rb</code>
                     These actions specify the appropriate response (a ‘method’) which is most likely to render the corresponding view,<code>ideas/index.html.erb</code>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section data-background="#dddddd">
                <p>If you look in your <code>ideas_controller.rb</code> you can see these actions and the associated behaviour, and the HTTP method that corresponds with each action:</p>
                <pre><code>
                def show
                    @idea = Idea.find(params[:id])

                    respond_to do |format|
                      format.html # show.html.erb
                      format.json { render json: @idea }
                    end
                  end

                  # GET /ideas/new
                  # GET /ideas/new.json
                </code></pre>
                <p> In this instance, <code>show</code> is the controller action that corresponds with the <strong>GET</strong> HTTP method. </code> </p>
